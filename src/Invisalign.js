                Invisalign is the breakthrough technology that lets you have the smile you've always wanted without the hassle of braces. 
                By using a series of clear, removable aligners, Invisalign straightens your teeth with results you'll notice sooner than you think. The course of treatment involves changing aligners approximately every two weeks, moving your teeth into straighter position step-by-step, until you have a more beautiful smile. And unlike conventional braces, these clear aligners can be removed while you eat and brush your teeth as usual. 
                An average Invisalign course of treatment takes about a year.
